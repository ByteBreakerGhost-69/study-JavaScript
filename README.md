# ðŸ“š JavaScript Journey (3 Days Challenge)

Hello, this is a record of my learning journey to master JavaScript in just 3 days.
My goal: to understand the basics of JavaScript well, create a small project, and be ready to move on to a framework/library.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Goals
- Master the basics of JavaScript (syntax, variables, data types, operators, functions, arrays, objects).
- Understand the DOM (Document Object Model) for manipulating HTML elements.
- Create a simple mini-project using pure JavaScript.
- Be ready to move on to the next level (React, Node.js, or Web3).

---

## ðŸ“† Learning Timeline

### ðŸ”¥ Day 1: JavaScript Fundamentals
- [x] Understand what JavaScript is and how it works in the browser.
- [x] Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`).
- [x] Data type (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object).
- [x] Operators (arithmetic, logic, comparison).
- [x] Output: `console.log`, `alert`, `document.write`, `innerHTML`

## ðŸ’» Tools
- Browser (Chrome/Firefox) + Developer Tools.
- Code Editor: VS Code.
- GitHub (to upload learning outcomes).

---

## ðŸŒŸ Next Step (After 3 Days)
- Learn ES6+ (classes, destructuring, spread/rest operators).
- Framework: React.js for the frontend.
- Backend: Node.js + Express.
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- Web3 / Blockchain (if interested).
